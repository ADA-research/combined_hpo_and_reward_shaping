### Behaviour Comparison between Baseline Agents and Combined Optimisation of Hyperparameters and Reward Shape

This directory contains videos comparing the behaviour of our baseline agents to the behaviour of agents with jointly tuned hyperparameters and reward parameters. 
The comparison is based on the optimisation run that achieved median performance out of the five runs in the combined optimisation experiment. 
We then evaluated the best, median, and worst policies from the ten evaluation seeds of the baseline
and the chosen optimisation run.
In each video, we recorded the interaction of an agent with the environment for five episodes.
The agent on the left is always the baseline agent, while the agent on the right is our tuned agent.
