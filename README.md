### Repository for the RLC Submission: Combined Optimisation of Hyperparameters and Reward Shape

This repository contains supplementary material for our research on combined optimisation of hyperparameters and reward shape in reinforcement learning. Below is an overview of the contents:

- `src`: Contains the source code used for running our landscape analysis and optimisation experiments, along with their corresponding configurations.
- `experimental_results/landscape_analysis`: Includes the landscape plots from the paper for the landscape analysis and the raw results of the preformed reinforcement learning trainings. 
- `experimental_results/optimisation_experiments`: Includes the performance plots of our different experiments and datasets for incumbent performance and evaluation results of each experiment. 
- `behaviour_comparison`: Features videos comparing the behavior of our optimised agents to baseline agents.

For more detailed information, please refer to the README file within each specific directory.
