### Optimisation Experiment Results

We present the different results of our optimisation experiments for PPO and SAC. All plots are
similar to the ones presented in the paper's appendix.

- `boxplots_separated.pdf`: Present the boxplots results over the 5 median performances of every optimisation experiment's runs.
- `boxplots_aggregated.pdf`: Present the boxplots results over the aggregated 50 evaluation trainings of every optimisation experiment.
- `incumbent_performance.pdf`: Present the median incumbent performance for each experiment's optimisation step.
- `optimisation_evaluation_results.csv`: Dataset of all the evaluation results for each experiment, optimisation seed, and evaluation seed.
- `optimisation_incumbent_data.csv`: Dataset of the incumbent performance of all experiments for each optimisation step and the final best-performing incumbent parameter configuration.
