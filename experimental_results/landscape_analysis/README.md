### Landscape Analysis Experimental Results

We present the following experimental results. The landscapes in the PDF files are similar to the
ones found in the paper's appendix.

- `landscape_algmin.pdf`: Landscapes of the various hyperparameter and reward weight pairs, with the blue line indicating the optimal hyperparameter value for each reward weight.
- `landscape_rewmin.pdf`: Landscapes of the various hyperparameter and reward weight pairs, with the blue line indicating the optimal reward weight for each hyperparameter value.
- `hyperparameter_reward-weight.csv`: CSV files containing the raw data of the landscapes, thus containing the PPO reinforcement learning results for each configuration pair and training seed.
